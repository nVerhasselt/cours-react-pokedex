This is a simple React application I have made to practice React before the internship I have done at the end of my training.

I can't share on github what I have done during my internship, but I would be pleased to show it during an interview.

I found this 7 hours youtube tutorial by Simon Dieny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCINeytlyRA&t=10691s&ab_channel=SimonDieny-CodeSenior

I followed the tutorial and got familiar with React, TypeScript and Materialize. 


It is important to notice that it's quite old and we don't use exactly the same syntaxe anymore. I also watched this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2a0cSC1Vz8&t=2232s&ab_channel=ViDev  
which describes modern React syntaxe.

It gave be basis to start using React.

I also used the official React documentation to develop the React / Spring Boot project I have worked on during my internship.

To start the API pok√©dex, run the command on terminal: npm run start:api

Then run the command: npm start
in another terminal: npm run start:api
